Team1-Autonomous System.
 
For the Autonomous Lab project, we will try to cover the required scenarios required to realise an Autonomous Truck Platooning. The following approach is taken-

  - UML Diagrams to explain different scenarios,e.g Requirements diagram, Sequence diagram , etc.
  - Modelling and verifying the system using UPPAAL Timed Automata.
  - Using deep-learning re-inforcement learning to realise a scenario.
  - Simulation using SUMO.
